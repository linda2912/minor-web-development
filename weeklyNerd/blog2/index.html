          She works at a UX research company. She is the head of business there. All the accounting and project managing goes through her.

          <a href='https://eend.nl/'>Eend</a> is a four people company specialising in UX research. They design a website for a client. <a href='https://eend.nl/'>Eend</a> works with a lot of freelancers to build the sites.

          The goal of <a href='https://eend.nl/'>Eend</a> is to help people get a better experience through the given site. They do this by:
          <ul>
            <li>Interviewing those people about their work, goals, and wishes.</li>
            <li>Making the companies be a listener instead of a sender.</li>
            <li>They always research the target instead of test the target.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The flow of <a href='https://eend.nl/'>Eend</a> is to interview the stakeholders, do user research, analyse the data, prototype, user research, analyse, prototype etc. When it's ready, it's going to integration stage. aka. they give te project to web developers.

          The cool part of this weekly nerd was that we as a group had to work. The exercise was that we had to analyse the <a href='http://www.amsterdamuas.com/'>HvA.nl</a> website. To do this, we got printed <a href='http://www.amsterdamuas.com/'>HvA</a> pages. We had to cut them and collect all the different functionality blocks.

          We did this for about an hour and I learn a few things. Firstly I learned again how powerful real-life can be. If someone wants to do this in Photoshop it would take hours. I notest that with most things that involve UX. It's so much faster to wireframe and test something than to make a whole mockup. Secondly that this is a really good way to check if your design is too messy.
