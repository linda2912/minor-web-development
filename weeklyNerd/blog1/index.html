          <h2>Who is Arjan Westerdiep?</h2>

        <p>
          He is a freelance frontend developer. In 2003, Arjan created the username Drububu. With this name, he creates technological and visual online pieces of art, pixel art, weird (but cool) stuff. Some of the things he creates are actually commercial assignments. His specialties are HTML5, Javascript, Usability, illustrations, and animations.

          <h2>The life of Drububu</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Drububu started with ten signature characters that represent him. He doesn't care in what programme you make it, the end result is what counts. When he finished his look, he noticed he wanted more. He wanted to make it pixel art. His process is as follows: first he draws it on paper, then when he's happy with it, he scans it and trace's it in MS paint.

          The drive for Drububu is simple. You always need to better yourself.

          He told us that you can do this by mirror an image that you made. This way it looks like it's a new image and because of that, your eyes can detect new things. Another tip that he gave us was that you just have to try it. If it fails, learn from it and more on.

        </header>
        <p>
          Nowadays Drububu is focussing on GPU technology. More precisely, how to use GPU technology to calculate stuff in Javascript. For this, he uses a Web worker. This is a script that runs on a separate thread on the CPU, because of this the Javascript doesn't block. If you want to know more about the Web worker, <a href='#'>please click here.</a>

          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;The good thing about knowing how to program is that you can just make your own drawing programme.&rdquo;
          </blockquote>
        <p>
          The reason why Drububu is focussing on GPU technology is because he uses WebGL to render 3d models in the browser. WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D computer graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. He made a Javascript programme that takes a 3D model and transforms it into a Lego model, with this model he can see how to build it, how many pieces are necessary, and what it will cost to buy all those pieces.
