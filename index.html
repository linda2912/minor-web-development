        <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Good day! This site acts like a hub for all my work that I do for the minor Web Development. Under the header of exercises you can select a task by clicking on it. This takes you to the site that was created for that task. I didn't create a menu icon to return to the hub or to other sites. Instead, I created a shortcut system. If you press <bold>ctrl + shift + 5</bold> there will pop up a modal that you can use to navigate through the courses and tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <bold>disclaimer!</bold> I know that this is NOT the correct way to build sites. The 'problem' with the setup is that the courses are loss modules. They don't connect with each other. So for example, CSS to the rescue focus's  on CSS, where Web app from scratch is all about Javascript. They need their own site. This means that every exercise has its own style.css and script.js.

        <h2>CSS to the Rescue</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        In this course the focus is around building a responsive website/web app for a complex layout. With this we must learn the principles of CSS. The website/web app will be build with the principles of progressive enhancement. This enables designers to design websites according to some predetermined support baseline and then gradually improve and optimize appearance and functionality to accommodate the most advanced browsers.

        <h2>Webapp from Scratch</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        In this course the focus is around building a web application from scratch. The reason why this course exists is to get a better understanding of single page web applications. What happens behind the scenes of Angular for example. The end goal is to make an web application with plain Javascript that can do the basic functionalities like getting data from an API, routing, setting the right template and handle interaction.
