      <p>
        For this research, the focus will be on the global use of libraries / frameworks. This means that there will be exceptions on this research.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first <a href='http://www.jscripters.com/jquery-disadvantages-and-advantages/'>site</a> that popped up in Google was jsscripters.com. This site is talking about the library Jquery and the pro's and con's of that. The reason why I use this as a legitimate source is because the points that he makes are relevant for every library. The writer talks about some basic principles when using libraries / frameworks. Later on in this research, those principles will be re-enforced or debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pro's of using libraries / frameworks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They're easy to use. They use the same language as the user (Javascript). The difference is that they do the heavy lifting while the user only has to call a function of them.
        </li>
        <li>
          They have good documentation. They tell the user in a more user-friendly tone what functions do. This is a whole other story when you look at the documentation of Javascript itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          They have a good number of functions. They are big and have a lot of functionality that they can offer the user.
        </li>
        <li>
          They have big communities. These communities are helpful when the user has a problem. Almost every communities have a forum that the user can post something on.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The con's of using libraries / frameworks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The amount of functions. The amount could be a big negative as well. If the user doesn't use all the function, it creates overhead. Overhead happens when a user needs to download a lot of code that he / she doesn't need. It's wasted bandwidth.
        </li>
        <li>
          The functions aren't written for a specific user. The function that they give to a user are generic. There is a big chance that the user needs to add his / her function after that to fine tune the output.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sites need longer to load. The more stuff the user adds to his / her site, the more the site needs to load. They are always bigger then when the user writes his own functions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      As mentioned, <a href='http://javascript.about.com/od/hintsandtips/a/liborself.htm'>Stephem Chapman</a>, a Javascript Expert, wrote an article about re-enforcing and debunking the standard list of pro's and con's about using libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is talking about one of the most used con's against using libraries. The sites need to load more argument. He says that, if the user uses the Google repository to load in the libraries (and frameworks) it will stay in cache. If more and more users use Google repository for that, the amount of loading will drastically lower, because everything is already in the cache from another site. The problem with this is that more users need to do this and it has to be the exact same version.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is also saying that it isn't true that it's so easy to use. It may be the same language, but the user still needs to learn the function names and sometimes the structure of using the library / framework. The time that the user puts into the libraries is wasted. He / she 
        could better write their own functions so the user learns to write Javascript better and create their own namespacing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The libraries are covered in both positive and negative ways, but the <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25152506/benefits-and-drawbacks-of-using-client-side-frameworks'>frameworks</a> didn't get much love yet. So a framework gives the ability to modulate. The user can use the same pieces of code in another part of the project of even different projects. This is the power of a framework. They give the user the ability to use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Templating, to re-use code</li>
        <li>Data-binding, real-time connecting of the template and client-side data</li>
        <li>Routing, the ability to show different data without reloading the page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are more advantages when using a framework, but these are the most common.
